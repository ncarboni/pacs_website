# PACS

Here you can find the content of the http://itndch.map.archi.fr/pacs website. 
Modifying it it is very easy, and it only need text editing. The text is then going to be synced with the website and transformed in html. The seciton starting with the number are the visible one, the rest it is now still invbisible to the end users.

Two examples are herby provided, concerning **Steps** & **Docs** 


####Steps
The section called Steps has a listing of all the identified steps with the BDP diagram and some explanation of it.    
Some text, initially elaborated during the redaction of article, is present, but it still needs some cleaning/refining    
**For modifying it:**  
Go to /2-steps/ and choose the steps you want to modify.   
There you can find a .txt . Open it and go the section “*Text*”. Once there you can see the text inserted in the article. Feel free to add/delete/change something.  Use [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)  
  

####Docs   
The section called Docs should host a listing of all the tables elements with their own definition, repeatability status etc. I added the general register as an example.      
**For modifying it:**   
Go to /3-docs/ and choose the steps you want to modify. For each of them there is a folder with the register name (ex: *Object register*). There you can find a .txt . Once it is open go the section “*Text*:”. There, you can add the elements following the stylistic example of the Project Defintion Step (Project Register is the most complete of the two).  Use [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
