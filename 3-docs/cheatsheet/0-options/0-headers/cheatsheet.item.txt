Title: headers

----

Excerpt: An array with template names as keys and HTTP headers as values. Those headers will be sent before the template is rendered.

----

Text: 

## Default value

```
array()
```

## Example
The array must contain a template as key. This is the actual used template and not the intended template (aka. content file name).

The value must be callable, so it should be a function containing the PHP code you want to execute (as shown in the example). 

```php
c::set('headers',array(
  'home' => function() {
    header('x-my-header: my-value');
  }
));
```

As a more simple alternative you can also just pass a valid HTTP status code:

```php
c::set('headers',array(
  'badrequest' => 503
));
```
