(toc:4)

(l3: Processing Action ID)
*For each processing round that occurs, a unique ID is assigned to this event in order to be able to retrieve it again in the future.*
Type: *Number*
Required: *YES*
Repeatable: *NO*

(l3: Part of Processing Plan	)	
*This field allows the indication of which processing plan, the data processing action was a part.*
Type: *Link - ((link: docs/processing/processing-plan-register text: Processing Plan Register))*
Required: *YES*
Repeatable: *NO*

(l3: Part of Processing Project)	
Type: *Link - ((link: docs/processing/processing-project-register text: Processing Project Register))*
Required: *YES*
Repeatable: *NO*

(l3: Processing Type	)	
*Here the researcher indicates the data processing type they used in this loop, choosing from a control list. This will, in general, be the same as the processing type planned for in the previous step.*
Type: *Text from Controlled List - ((link: http://# text: Processing Type))*
Required: *NO*
Repeatable: *YES*

(l3: Methodology Used)
*Here the methodology employed in executing this processing loop is specified by picking from a controlled list of methodologies. This list is enumerated at the end of this document.*
Type: *Text from Controlled List - ((link: http://# text: Methodology))*
Required: *YES*
Repeatable: *YES*

(l3: Data Processing Technician)	
*Here the researcher who initiated and was responsible for this particular data processing action is indicated by linking to the actor register.*
Type: *Link - ((link: docs/general-register/actor-register text: Actors Register))*
Required: *YES*
Repeatable: *YES*

(l3: Software Used)	
*Here the software programme used in this processing action is listed.*
Type: *Text from Controlled List - ((link: http://# text: Software))*
Required: *YES*
Repeatable: *NO*

(l3: Hardware Used)	
*Here a link to the hardware devices used in the carrying out of the process.*
Type: *Link - ((link: docs/general-register/equipment-register text: Equipment Register))*
Required: *NO*
Repeatable: *NO*

(l3: Algorithm Used)	
*Here the algorithm used in this processing action is listed.*
Type: *Text from Controlled List - ((link: http://# text: Algorithm))*
Required: *NO*
Repeatable: *NO*

(l3: Used Input Files)	
*Here we link to the particular input files used in this process. We link to the digital asset register and generally would take from the files generated in acquisition events. For a control step, link to the control measurement object.*
Type: *Link - ((link: docs/general-register/digital-asset text: Digital Assets Register))*
Required: *YES*
Repeatable: *YES*

(l3: Used Parameters)	
*Here we list the parameters invoked in the process. We indicate the parameter and the value. This is a multivalue field.*
Type: *Text + Value*
Required: *YES*
Repeatable: *YES*

(l3: Had Output Files)	
*Here we indicate the files that were generated by the process. They will in fact form part of the overall digital assets register of the project.*
Type: *Link - ((link: docs/general-register/digital-asset text: Digital Assets Register))*
Required: *YES*
Repeatable: *YES*

(l3: Accuracy Type)	
*Here we indicate the accuracy type obtained.*
Type: *Text from Controlled List - ((link: http://# text: Accuracy Type))*
Required: *NO*
Repeatable: *NO*

(l3: Accuracy Value)	
*Here we indicate the value of the accuracy type obtained.*
Type: *Number*
Required: *NO*
Repeatable: *NO*

(l3: Processing Outcome Acceptable)	
*Here the researcher indicates if the processing outcome is acceptable and meets the criteria set out in the processing plan step. If the answer is no, the data and this metadata are still kept but the data processing plan is reevaluated and another round of processing is iterated.*
Type: *Boolean*
Required: *NO*
Repeatable: *NO*

(l3: Processing Outcome Evaluation Note)	
*This field is used for a free text analysis of the processing outcome. It can be used by the processor in order to indicate features including elements of success and failure of the process.*
Type: *Long Text*
Required: *NO*
Repeatable: *NO*

(l3: Processing Date)	
*Here the date on which the processing occurred is indicated.*
Type: *Date*
Required: *YES*
Repeatable: *NO*
